A list of games that have been tested with the ADJI ROM.

`*JKEYS` is the suggested command line for the game, probably using
the overlay routine. `X?` indicates whether the game will also work
with `*JKEYS ... X`.

`*JJOY` is the suggested command line for the game, assuming the game
supports joysticks. Again, `X?` indicates whether the game will also
work with `*JJOY ... X`.

For games that only need left/right or up/down, but not both, I've
assigned dummy keys to the unused axis.

# Electron
